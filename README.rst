Installation
------------
This project is managed with Python `Poetry <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry>`_. With Poetry installed
correctly, simply clone this project and run::

    poetry install

To test the project, run::

    poetry run pytest

In order to run the program functions, see below.

Introduction
------------
This project functions as part of the larger wh00t project. This particular repository's purpose is
to act as a chat client.

wh00t_client.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This process functions as the wh00t chat client. wh00t_client.py requires that an ``.env`` file is available
in the *same* directory it is running under. The format of the .env file should contain ``SERVER_ADDRESS``, and
``SERVER_PORT`` as defined environmental variables.

| ``SERVER_ADDRESS`` : The chat server address
| ``SERVER_PORT`` : The port the chat server is listening on

An explained ``.env`` file format is shown below::

    SERVER_ADDRESS=<Server address>
    SERVER_PORT=<Server port>

A typical ``.env`` file may look like this::

    SERVER_ADDRESS=192.168.0.102
    SERVER_PORT=3001

To run the script once the environment (.env) file is created, from within the wh00t_server directory, simply type::

    poetry run python wh00t_client/wh00t_client.py

To exit the client, simply hit the close button on the client window, or type the exit command (``/exit``) into
the message input field and hit send.

Client Options
----------------------

keyboard mappings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the message input field is selected, the following keyboard bindings are in affect:

| ``UpKey`` : will allow you to go through your message history and select it for editing and resending
| ``DownKey`` : will erase text currently in the message input field
| ``PageUp`` and ``PageDown`` : scroll, in the input message box, through a subset of quick support emojis shortcodes
| ``EscKey`` : print the ``exit_string`` command in the message input field

emojis
~~~~~~~
A certain subset of emoji shortcodes are supported.  Emoji shortcodes can be researched at
`emojipedia <https://emojipedia.org/shortcodes/>`_.  The following are examples of phrases with emoji shortcodes::

    Hi there :smile:, How are you today?
    Doing great, :thumbsup:
    Hey, :thinking_face: I have a question for you...

Which would produce::

    Hi there üòÑ, how are you today?
    Doing great, üëç
    Hey, ü§î I have a question for you...

You can scroll, in the input message box, through a subset of quick support emoji shortcodes to inject into
your messages by using the ``PageUp`` and ``PageDown`` keys on the keyboard.
